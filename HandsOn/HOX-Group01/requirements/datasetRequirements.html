<h1>Dataset Requirements - Madrid's Daily Metereology</h1>
<h2>Requirement 1: Data are in one of the smart city domains</h2>
<p>The dataset belongs mainly to the Smart Environment domain of Smart Cities, with intersections in Smart Living/Health, 
    since it tracks temperature using geolocated stations over time.</p>
<h2>Requirement 2: Data are available as a CSV file</h2>
<p>The selected dataset is available as a CSV file, which is located inside the folder "CSV FILES" uploaded for the first assignment</p>
<h2>Requirement 3:  Data have an open license so they can be published</h2>
<p>The open license of this data can be found in the following link: <a href="https://datos.madrid.es/egob/catalogo/aviso-legal">https://datos.madrid.es/egob/catalogo/aviso-legal</a>
</p>
<h2>Requirement 4: Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities</h2>
<p>The dataset can be easily linked with real-world entities such as geographic areas (province, municipality, station) and time 
    (days, months, years). Fields like “PROVINCIA”, “MUNICIPIO” and “ESTACION” directly map to real-world locations, referring to 
    administrative areas and physical meteorological stations. Similarly, “ANO”, “MES”, “D01”, “D02”, etc., represent actual calendar 
    dates, making the dataset directly relatable to external sources such as other meteorological records, climate models, traffic 
    patterns or public health data for the same period.
    In this dataset, which contains meteorological information for Madrid, several attributes can be directly associated with generic
     real-world entities:
<ul>
<li>Measurement stations, such as Plaza España, Escuelas Aguirre, or Cuatro Caminos, which correspond to physical monitoring sites across the city.</li>
<li>Geographical entities, including province, municipality, and neighborhood, which situate each measurement station in its real location.</li>
<li>Meteorological variables, such as temperature, humidity, wind direction, or precipitation, which represent physical environmental conditions 
    that can be observed and compared with global standards.</li></p>
</ul>
<h2>Requirement 5: Documentation exists for the data (optional)</h2>
<p>The dataset is fully documented by the Dirección General de Sostenibilidad y Control Ambiental.
    It explains the meaning of each field (province, municipality, station, parameter, measurement technique, year, month, day), 
    the coding of meteorological variables (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation), and the mapping of station 
    codes to real locations. It also specifies the validation rules, indicating that only data marked with the code “V” are valid. 
    This ensures the dataset is standardized, interpretable, and suitable for integration into Smart City applications.
